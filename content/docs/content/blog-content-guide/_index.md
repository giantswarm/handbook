## Content Quality Guidelines

### Technical Accuracy

- All technical content must be peer-reviewed
- Include working code examples when applicable
- Provide clear explanations of complex concepts
- Link to relevant documentation
- Update content when technology changes

### Writing Style

#### Voice and Tone

- Write with authority but without arrogance - we're sharing knowledge, not showing off
- Use active voice: "We deployed the cluster" vs "The cluster was deployed"
- Address the reader directly using "you" to create engagement
- Include your personal experiences and lessons learned - authenticity matters
- Keep sentences short and purposeful (aim for max 25 words per sentence)

#### Technical Writing

- Define technical terms on first use, even if they seem obvious
- Use concrete examples instead of abstract concepts
- Include real-world scenarios that readers can relate to
- Break down complex ideas into digestible chunks
- Show both what works AND what doesn't - failed approaches are valuable lessons

#### Engagement Techniques

- Open with a hook that connects to reader pain points
- Use analogies to explain complex technical concepts
- Include dialogue and personal experiences where relevant
- Ask rhetorical questions to make readers think
- End sections with forward-looking statements or questions

### Structure

#### Title and Headers

- Main title should be specific and searchable
- Use question-style headers to address reader concerns directly
- Keep headers under 60 characters
- Ensure headers follow a logical hierarchy
- Use action words in headers: "Implementing" vs "Implementation"
