## Core Principles


Every blog post should:


- Transform complex challenges into clear, actionable insights
- Demonstrate deep technical expertise while remaining accessible
- Connect technical solutions to business value
- Share authentic experiences that readers can learn from





## Types of Impact

### Technical Deep Dives


Show readers exactly how to solve pressing challenges:


- Start with the problem, not the solution
- Include real-world scenarios and failure modes
- Provide complete, tested solutions
- Share performance implications and trade-offs
- Include troubleshooting guides for common issues


Example structure:


```
# How We Reduced Kubernetes Deployment Times by 80%The problem: Our customers were struggling with 20+ minute deployment timesThe impact: Release delays, frustrated developers, missed opportunitiesOur journey: The approaches we tried, what failed, what workedThe solution: Detailed implementation with code and architectureThe results: Performance data, developer feedback, lessons learned
```

### Industry Insights


Help readers navigate complex decisions:


- Start with a current challenge in the field
- Present multiple approaches with pros/cons
- Share concrete examples from our experience
- Provide clear decision frameworks
- Include cost and complexity trade-offs


Example structure:


```
# Platform Engineering: Build vs Buy vs ExtendThe dilemma: What we're seeing across our customer baseThe approaches: Detailed analysis of each optionReal examples: Success and failure storiesDecision framework: How to choose the right approachImplementation guide: First steps for each path
```





### Technical Tutorials

Transform complex topics into learnable skills:


- Start with the end goal and prerequisites
- Break complex processes into clear steps
- Include debugging and troubleshooting
- Show common mistakes and how to avoid them
- Provide verification steps for each stage


Example structure:


```
# Implementing Zero-Trust Security in KubernetesThe goal: What you'll achieve and why it mattersPrerequisites: Required setup and knowledgeStep-by-step guide: Detailed implementationVerification: How to test your implementationTroubleshooting: Common issues and solutions
```
