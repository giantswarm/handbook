This page contains useful information for qualifying and identifying issues raised on support.

## Support Template: qualifying a request

The first thing a person on support needs to understand is where the issue is happening and what is the scope of the issue. This is important because it will help us to understand if the issue is related to the platform or not and how urgent it is.

A good way to do this is to gather enough information to answer all the following questions:

- Which installation (Management Cluster) is affected?
- Is the problem affecting the Management Cluster or a Workload Cluster? In the latter case, which Workload Cluster is it?
- What is the impact? Can users "feel it", or is it just a warning or a red light in some monitoring tool?
- Is the issue affecting a single user or multiple users?
- Is the issue affecting multiple clusters? If so, which ones?
- If the issue is affecting multiple clusters, which cluster is the "most important" one?
- Did anything change in the cluster recently?
- Is the issue a real issue, or is it just a question about how to do something or a feature request? If it is not an issue, we can move the discussion to a GitHub issue.
