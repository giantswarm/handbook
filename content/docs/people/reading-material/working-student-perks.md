🏝 paid holiday

As a working student in Germany, you are entitled to paid vacation days, just like regular employees. The number of days you get depends on how many days per week you work, e.g. if you work 3 days per week: 12 vacation days per year. If you want to take more holiday or have further question feel free to ask Team-Up.
