## We have a Book flatrate!

This means if you have a book that you want to read – buy it and get it reimbursed by Giant Swarm. Buy it via Spendesk, if you want to buy it in a local store to support your local dealer you can reimburse it via Spendesk. Spendesk is THE tool of choice here!

Yes – any book (also audiobooks) that you are interested in!

### Important!

Unfortunately German tax law decided to make things difficult. Therefore the following rules apply:

- Do not spend more than 44 EUR each month.
- Only buy books between the 1st and the 20st of each month. Book flatrate is closed from the 21st till the end of each month.
- When purchasing from the shop, use the billing address “Giant Swarm GmbH, Im Mediapark 5, 50670 Cologne”.
- Use the [Book Log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aLbQcybAtjLY90r7v62F0HT7D1nIYOnIWeO3IbI8vt8) to add your purchased books.
- Please add book flatrate in the description for payments or reimbursements via spendesk.
- Choose the `GiantSwarm` cost center in Spendesk.
- Once you receive the invoice, upload it to Spendesk as soon as possible. Set the correct purchase date (do not confuse month/day).
- After reading a book, consider posting in [#chat-books](https://gigantic.slack.com/archives/C8G9RH8RK) how you liked it. If you want to exchange books with others, our on-site events are a good place in case you have enough room in your luggage.
