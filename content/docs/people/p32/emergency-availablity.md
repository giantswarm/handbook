# Ground Rule

You are generally expected to be reachable for emergencies during your P32 day. This has been established in the [ground rules](https://intranet.giantswarm.io/docs/people/p32/ground-rules/) of P32 and is your duty to ensure.

> Everyone needs to make sure that their phone number in Personio is correct and reachable!

# Reaching Engineers

Engineers are available through [Opsgenie](https://giantswarm.app.opsgenie.com/alert/list). Reaching out can easily be done by creating an `alert` through the Opsgenie UI and assigning the person you need to contact.

# General Outreach

Everyone is expected to be reachable by phone during their P32 day. You can find phone numbers in [Personio](https://giant-swarm.personio.de/staff) in the public profile.
