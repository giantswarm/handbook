          # This does not work if triggered from the `rfc` repo (https://github.com/giantswarm/rfc/blob/main/.github/workflows/render.yaml) due to error
          # "Unable to request reviewers. If requesting team reviewers a 'repo' scoped PAT is required." (using Taylor Bot token).
          # So instead, sig-docs was added to CODEOWNERS on RFC-related paths.
